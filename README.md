# ML-for-used-car-prices
A machine learning project for approximating used car prices with a variety of ML models (commented in Russian)

I've made this project as a part of my data science and machine learning course at Yandex Practicum. In this project compare I use a dataset with to train a variety of models for predicting used car prices. Utilized models range from sklearn's linear regression and random forest to gradient boosting (LightGBM and Catboost). The project begins with analysing and preprocessing the dataset. Then I train everything, while discussing and optimizing hyperparameters. Then I make the final prediction with the best model. I conclude with a brief summarize, noting perfomance of every model both result-wise and time-wise and discussing feature importances.
